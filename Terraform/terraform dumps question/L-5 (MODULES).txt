1. When you add a new module to a configuration, Terraform must download it before it can be used. What two commands can be used to download and update modules? (select two)

terraform init
terraform get

2. CAN WE REFER VALUES TO MAIN BLOCK ?
ANS: YES

3. From where the module is coming from ?

module "iam" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws"
  version = "5.46.0"
}

ANS: the Terraform public registry

4. What do the declarations, such as name, cidr, and azs, in the following Terraform code represent and what purpose do they serve

module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
 
  name = var.vpc_name
  cidr = var.vpc_cidr
}

ANS: these are variables that are passed into the child module likely used for resource creation

5. What are some of the requirements that must be met in order to publish a module on the Terraform Public Registry? 
ANS:
The module must be on GitHub and must be a public repo.
Release tag names must be for the format x.y.z, and can optionally be prefixed with a v .
Module repositories must use this three-part name format, terraform-<PROVIDER>-<NAME>.


6. A Terraform module (usually the root module of a configuration) can call other modules to include their resources into the configuration. A module that has been called by another module is often referred to as _______________.

called module
parent module
sourced module
child module : True

7 . From Belwo snippet below. Where will Terraform download the referenced module from?


terraform {
  required_providers {
    kubernetes = {
      source = "hashicorp/kubernetes"
      version = "2.6.1"
    }
  }
}
 
provider "kubernetes" {
  # Configuration below
...

the official Terraform public registry : TRUE
from the hashicorp/kubernetes directory where Terraform is executed
from the configured VCS provider in the hashicorp/kubernetes repo

8.  where is the module that the code is referencing?

module "server_subnet_1" {
  source          = "./modules/web_server"
  ami             = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  key_name        = aws_key_pair.generated.key_name
  user            = "ubuntu"
}


Ans: in the modules subdirectory in the current working directory where Terraform is being executed

9. You've included two different modules from the official Terraform registry in a new configuration file. When you run a terraform init, where does Terraform OSS download and store the modules locally?

ANS: in the .terraform/modules folder in the working directory

10. A child module created a new subnet for some new workloads. What Terraform block type would allow you to pass the subnet ID back to the parent module?

terraform block
resource block
output block : true
data block

11. True or False? When referencing a module, you must specify the version of the module in the calling module block.
ans: False

12. Can the child modules refer to any of the variables declared in the parent module?
ANS: Not the variable, but it can only refer to values that are passed to the child module

13. You have a module named prod_subnet that outputs the subnet_id of the subnet created by the module. How would you reference the subnet ID when using it for an input of another module?

ANS: subnet = module.prod_subnet.subnet_id

14. a single module can be called many times in a single configuration file
ANS: True

15. True or False? Official Terraform providers and modules are owned and maintained by HashiCorp.
Ans: True

16. You have declared a variable named db_connection_string inside of the app module. However, when you run a terraform apply, you get the following error message:

Error: Reference to undeclared input variable
 
on main.tf line 35:
4: db_path = var.db_connection_string
 
An input variable with the name "db_connection_string" has not been declared. This variable can be declared with a variable "db_connection_string" {} block.

ANS:
since the variable was declared within the module, it cannot be referenced outside of the module

17. From  the snippet below. Where is this particular module stored?



module "consul" {
  source = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
  version = "0.1.0"
}

ANS: 
locally in the hashicorp/consul/aws directory
a private registry supported by your organization
public Terraform registry: TRUE
locally but a directory back from the current directory

18. Where is the module below stored?



module "monitoring_tools" {
  source = "./modules/monitoring_tools"
 
  cluster_hostname = module.k8s_cluster.hostname
}

ANS:
on the Terraform public registry
in a public GitLab repository
a private registry in Terraform Cloud (free)
locally on the instance running Terraform: True

19. Which of the following are the benefits of using modules in Terraform? (select three)

ans:
Allows modules to be stored anywhere accessible by Terraform : False
enables code reuse: True
supports versioning to maintain compatibility: True
supports modules stored locally or remotely: True

20. Given the following snippet of code, what does servers = 4 reference?

module "servers" {
  source = "./modules/aws-servers"
 
  servers = 4
}

ANS: the value of an input variable


21. Raham is calling a child module to deploy infrastructure for her organization. he specifies the module version he wants to use even though there are newer versions available. During a terrafom init, Terraform downloads v0.0.5 just as expected.

What would happen if Margaret removed the version parameter in the module block and ran a terraform init again?

Ans: Terraform would use the existing module already downloaded


22. Raham is using a module to deploy some EC2 instances on AWS for a new project. He is viewing the code that is calling the module for deployment, which is shown below. Where is the value of the security group originating?

module "ec2_instances" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version = "4.3.0"
 
  name           = "my-ec2-cluster"
  instance_count = 2
 
  ami                    = "ami-0c5204531f799e0c6"
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [module.vpc.default_security_group_id]
  subnet_id              = module.vpc.public_subnets[0]
 
  tags = {
    Terraform   = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
  }

ANS: the output of another module



23. By default, a child module will have access to all variables set in the calling (parent) module.
ANS: False

24. Which of the following statements are true about this code? (select two)

module "servers" {
  source = "./app-cluster"
 
  servers = 5
}

ans: 

app-cluster is the child module : True
main.tf is the child module
main.tf is the calling module : True
app-cluster is the calling module

25. Published modules via the Terraform Registry provide which of the following benefits? (select four)


allow browsing version histories: True
automatically generated documentation: True
show examples and READMEs: True
support versioning: True
support from any code repo: False

26. You found a module on the Terraform Registry that will provision the resources you need. What information can you find on the Terraform Registry to help you quickly use this module?

ANS:
Required Input Variables
A list of Outputs
Dependencies to use the Module
