=================01-09-2025==== Session 5=======================>

8) S3 Storage:
------------------

i ) WHAT IS S3 => 
 -> Amazon S3 is a Simple Storage Service 
  -> stores objects like files, Photos, Audio, Videos 
  -> providing more scalability and security to. 
  -> It allows the users to store and retrieve .
  -> Many companies use s3 to store customers data.
  -> it has infinite scaling capacity. 

ii ) ADVANTAGES =>
  -> To store all types of Data
  -> Static web hosting
  -> Big Data Analytics
  -> Backup and Recovery
  -> Highly scalable & Flexible
  -> Low Cost

iii ) ATRRIBUTES=>
  -> Key
  -> Version ID
  -> Value
  -> Metadata
  -> Access control information
  -> Tags

iv ) HOW MUCH IS FREE=> 
  -> There is a limit of 100 buckets per AWS account(exp)
  -> But it can be increased if requested by AWS support.
  -> The maximum size of an AWS S3 bucket is 5 GB.

v ) WAYS TO UPLOAD FILES=> 
  -> GUI
  -> CLI
  -> API
  -> SDK

vi ) RULES=> 
  -> 3 (min) and 63 (max) characters long.
  -> can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, 
  -> dots (.), and hyphens (-).
  -> must begin and end with a letter or number.
  -> Bucket names must not contain two adjacent periods.
  -> Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address 
 -> (for example, 192.168.5.4).

9) VERSIONING=> 
------------------------
  -> Versioning means Copy of a Object.
 ->  If You delete a file we can retrive using Versioning.
  -> By default it will be disabled.
  -> Each file will have Different Version Id.
  -> You can always restore the previous version.

10) How to create S3 bucket:
---------------------------------------
    Step 1: Go to S3 and click on this
    Step 2: Click on the "Create Bucket"
    Step 3: Give Bucket name 
    Step 4: Enable and Disable Bucket Versioning (for backup)
    Step 5: and click on the Create button and do not make the changes any other option  
    Step 6: Now my s3 bucket will be created

11) Presigned Image URL:
-----------------------------------
      - Presigned Image URL is that URL where we can give time limit to show the image on the URL once time limit end it will not be visible.
      
      Step 1: Click on the image checkbox
      Step 2: Click on the Action and go to Presigned URL
      Step 3: give the time limit (min/hr)
      Step 4: finaly click on the Create  Presigned URL.

=================02-09-2025==== Session 6=======================>

CRR OR data sharing:
-----------------------------

12) CRR: Cross resion Replication.:
-----------------------------------------------
   -> CRR stands for Cross-Region Replication, a feature that automatically replicates Amazon S3 objects and their metadata from one AWS region to another.

13) Batch Operations:
------------------------------
      -> When we perform same operation with multiple file the it is called Batch Operations.

14) How to create CRR:
--------------------------------
Step 1: 1st create two bucket in two different region. while creating bucket versioning has to be enabled.
Step 2: Go to 1st bucket --> go to management --> Click on the "Create replication rule" button.
Step 3: Give "Replication rule name" name and status will be Enabled.
step 4: Choose a rule scope as "Apply to all objects in the bucket".
Step 5: select Destination bucket by clicking on "Browse S3" --> after Choosing a bucket click on the "Choose path".
Step 6: after above process my CRR is done  


15) Storage classes or (Life cycle rule):
----------------------------------------------------
-> By help of the storage clases we can reduce the cost of the storage.

i) Types of Storage classes:
-> Standard
-> AI (infrequent access)
-> One Zone
-> Glacier

ii) How to create storage classes
-> Step 1: Open bucket --> go to management
-> Step 2: Click on the "Create lifecycle rule".
-> Step 3: Give Lifecycle rule name and Choose a rule scope as "Apply to all objects in the bucket".
-> Step 4: Go to Lifecycle rule actions section and Click on the Transition current versions of objects between storage classes Checkbox.
-> Step 5: Go to "Transition current versions of objects between storage classes" section and "Choose storage class transitions" and "Days after object creation".
-> Step 6: Click on Create rule.


=================03-09-2025==== Session 7=======================>

16) Web Server:
-------------
-> Web servers like Apache and Nginx are fundamental software applications that deliver web content to users over the internet. They act as intermediaries between client web browsers and the server where website files are stored. When a user requests a webpage, the web server processes that request, retrieves the necessary files (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images), and sends them back to the user's browser.

i) Type of Web server:
     -> Apache 
     -> Ngnix
     -> IIS

ii) How to create Application by Apache webser by ubuntu.
    Step 1:  website: https://killercoda.com/
    Step 2:  select playground
    Step 3:  select ubuntu
    Step 4: give below code one-by-one
                -> apt update                
                -> apt install apache2 -y        
                -> git clone https://github.com/Ironhack-Archive/online-clone-amazon.git
                -> mv online-clone-amazon/* /var/www/html
    Step 5:  One all above step done then click on the "trafix and port" in the top right humburger.
    Step 6:  Click on the Common Ports 80 and then my app will open Exa: https://546b56424455-10-244-5-62-80.papa.r.killercoda.com/

iii) How to create Application by AWS
    Step 1:  Ceate a server in EC2
    Step 2:  click on the server checkbox and click on the connect --> then again click on the connect.
    Step 3: give below code one-by-one
                -> sudo -i
                -> apt update                
                -> apt install apache2 -y (for apache)  |  apt install nginx  -y (for ngnix)
                -> git clone https://github.com/Ironhack-Archive/online-clone-amazon.git
                -> mv online-clone-amazon/* /var/www/html

=================04-09-2025==== Session 8=======================>

17) MULTI CLOUD:
-------------------------
->  Multi-cloud means a company uses two or more cloud providers—such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Etc To deploy the infrastructure & applications.

i) ADVANTAGES:
-> Avoid Vendor Lock-In
-> High Availability
->  Best-of-Breed Services
-> Geographical Compliance

ii) EC2 Termination protection:
-> Termination protection prevents an instance from accidental termination. By default, this option is turned off for EC2 instances. Turn on this option to protect your instance from any unintentional termination.
-> while creating instance we need to enable it in the Advanced details.

=================05-09-2025==== Session 9=======================>

18) Server migration:
----------------------
19) Disaster recovery:
-----------------------
20) AMI (AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE) :
i) Advantage: An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) in AWS is a template used to launch virtual servers (EC2 instances) in the cloud like OS, server, S/w. 
-> Disaster recovery
-> backup
-> Speed

ii) CATEGORIES Of AMI:
-> QUICK START    : AWS
-> MY AMI         : YOU
-> MARKET PLACE   : TO SELL OUR AMIS
-> COMMUNITY      : WE CAN USE OTHER PEOPLE AMI FOR FREE        

iii) How to migrate server from one resion to another resion.

Step 1: 1st Create a Server By EC2 and give script in the 1st server on Mumbai (or any other resion).
Step 2: Click on the server checkbox and click on the action --> Image and template --> Create image.
Step 3: Give image name in the "Image details".
Step 4: once image is created go to --> AMI 
Step 5: go to ami -> Copy AMI --> give AMI copy name -->Destination Region --> click on "Copy AMI".
Step 6: new link will be generated click on that link it will redirect with new 
Step 7: In the newly created AMI click on the AMI checkbox and click on the --> Launch instance from AMI.
Step 8: give name in the "Name and tags" section. and Instance type and key-pair and allow ports (ssh, http, https) from Network settings
Step 9: Important Note : here we will not give script because we have lready given script in the image.
Step 10: here our server completed copy the IP Address and open in new tab , here we will see newly app.



=================06-09-2025==== Session 10=======================>

1)Practice session of  server migration
2) GCP and azure practice.

=================08-09-2025==== Session 11=======================>

21) ELP (Elastic load balancer):
------------------------------------------
-> Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) in AWS automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones.

i) How to create ELB (elastic load balancer):
Step 1: 1st create 2 or more server server with same application script.
Step 2: Go to load balancer --> select the Load balancers --> click on the create load balencer.
Step 3: Now click on the Create button of the Application Load Balancer.
Step 4: Give Basic configuration like any name, Scheme as Internet-facing, and select Availability Zones and subnets, In Security groups select & all. and also select  (WAF) rest as it is.
Step 5: In the Listeners and routing section click on the "Create target group " it will redirect to new tab and create target group.
Step 6: In Basic configuration select instance, -> give Target group name (any name)--> Click on the next.
Step 7: Now select all or whet ever server we want to give to ELB in Available instances. --> and click "Include as pending below" button
Step 8: Now click on the "Create target group" button and go back to previous tab.
Step 9: here refresh default action button in the "Create target group" section.
Step 10: at the end click on the "Create load balancer" now ELB will be created copy DNS and paste into  new tab.



ii) HOW TO ENABLE NEW AZ TO LB:
-> SELECT LB
-> NETWORK MAPPING
-> EDIT
-> SELECT 1-C SUBNET
-> SAVE

Note: PROVISIONING MEANS CREATING.


iii) TYPES OF ALOGRTHMS:
1. ROUND ROBIN (DEFAULT)
2. STICKY ROUND ROBIN
3. WEIGHTED
4. IP/URL
5. LEAST CONNECTIONS
6. LEAST TIME
7. RANDOM
8. LEAST BAND WIDTH

iv) HOW TO CHANGE ALOGORITHMS:
SELECET TAGRGET GROUP -- > ATTRIBITES -- > Load balancing algorithm


V) IMP POINTS:
1. LB WORKS ON OSI MODEL.
2. LB DISTRIBUTE TRAFFIC ON ALOGRITHEMS.
3. DEAFULT ALOGORITHM FOR LB IS ROUND ROBIN.
4. TO CREATE A LB ATLEAST WE NEED TO HAVE 2 SERVERS.
5. IN REAL TIME SERVERS WILL AUTOMATIACLLY ADD TO LB.
6. TO CREATE LB WE NEED TO SELECT ATLEAST 2 AZ (availability zone).

TYPES OF ROUTING:
1. HOST BASED ROUTING: www.train.paytm.com
2. PATH BASED ROUTING: www.paytm.com/train, www.paytm.com/recharge

=================09-09-2025==== Session 12=======================>

22) ASG (Auto Scaling Groups):
------------------------------
--> IT IS A PROCESS OF ADDING/REMOVING SERVERS AUTOMATIC..
--> WHEN LOAD IS INCRESED IT WILL ADD SERVERS
--> WHEN LOAD IS DECREASED IT REMOVE SERVERS
--> IT MAKE SURE ALWAYS MINIMU NUMBER OF
--> SERVERS ARE RUNNING TO SERVER APPLICATION
--> IF WE DELETE A SERVER ASG WILL RECREATE SAME SERVER.
--> LOAD IS HIGH -- > ADD THE NEW SERVERS
--> LOAD IS LOW  -- > TO DELETE EXISTING SERVERS

i) WHEN WE USE AUTO SCALING GROUPS:
   --> IF THE LOAD IS CHANGING FREQUENTLY WE CAN USE ASG.


ii) TYPES OF SCALING:
    1. HORIZONTAL SCALING : WE CREATE NEW SERVERS 
    2. VERTICAL SCALING   : FOR EXISTING SERVERS WE CAN INCREASE CPU & RAM


Note:-
        --> WEB & APP : HORIZONTAL SCALING
         --> DB        : VERTICAL SCALING

23) VERTICAL SCALING
      1. STOP SERVER
      2. ACTIONS -- > INSTANCE SETTINGS -- > CHANGE INSTANCE TYPE -- > t2.medium
      3. START SERVER

24) Horizontal Scaling
 --> AUTO SCALING GROUP -- > CREATE
 --> NAME: SWIGGY
  --> CREATE A LAUNCH TEMPLATE
  --> NAME: SWIGGY-TEMPLATE
  --> NOTE: GIVE THE CONFIGURATION JUST LIKE WE GIVE FOR EC2.

i) Script:
#! /bin/bash
 sudo -i
 apt update
 apt install nginx  -y
 cd /var/www/html/
 git clone https://github.com/Ironhack-Archive/online-clone-amazon.git
 mv online-clone-amazon/* .

 ii) CREATE TEMPLATE
 --> AZ AND SUBNETS: US-EAST-1A, US-EAST-1B, US-EAST-1C
  --> LOAD BALANCING: ATTACH TO A NEW LOAD BALANCER
  --> SELECT CREATE A NEW TARGET GROUP
  --> NEXT
  --> DESIRED : 2 -- > HOW MANY SERVERS YOU WANT NOW
  --> MIN: 2 -- > ALWAYS ATLEAST I WANT 2 SERVERS
  --> MAX: 10 -- > IF LOAD IS INCREASE I WANT 10 SERVERS
  --> AUTOMATIC SCALING POLICY:
  --> TARGET TRACKING SCALING POLICY:
  --> CPU -- > VALUE: 50 -- > NEXT
  --> NOTIFICATION -- > CREATE A TOPIC -- > NAME: SWIGGY SERVERS -- > EMAIL:
  --> give your email -- > NEXT -- > NEXT -- > CREATE AUTO SCALING GROUP


NOTIFICATION -- > CREATE A TOPIC -- > NAME: SWIGGY SERVERS -- > EMAIL: give your email -- > NEXT -- > NEXT -- > CREATE AUTO SCALING GROUP
 

iii) how to increase load:

  --> LOGIN TO SERVER:
  --> apt update -y
  --> apt install stress -y
  --> stress -c4


NOTE: TO DELETE SERVERS WE NEED TO DELETE ASG.
 --> if you remove servers directly because of auto scaling group servers are going to recreate.


Q1. WHY WE NEED ASG ?
A: IF THE LOAD IS CHANGING FREQUENTLY WE CAN USE ASG.

Q2. TYPES OF ASG ?
A.  1. HORIZONTAL SCALING : WE CREATE NEW SERVERS 
    2. VERTICAL SCALING   : FOR EXISTING SERVERS WE CAN INCREASE CPU & RAM

Q3. HOW ASG IS GOING TO SCALE SERVERS ?
A. TRACKING POLICY: USED TO SCALE THE SERVERS
1. CPU 
2. NETWORK IN
3. NETWORK OUT
4. COUNT PER TARGET

Q8. HOW WILL ASG KNOWS ABOUT CPU PERCENTAGE OF SERVER ?
A. USING CLOUD WATCH

=================10-09-2025==== Session 13=======================>


24) cloud watch:
-----------------------

-> CLOUD INFRA: COMBINATION OF HARDWARE & SOFTWARE 
-> RESOURCES USED TO RUN APP ON CLOUD.
-> EX: EC2, ELB, ASG, S3, VPC -----------

-> CLOUD WATCH: TO MONITOR THE CLOUD RESOURCE
-> NOTE:BY DEFAULT MONITORING FOR EC2 IS ENABLED

SERVER 		: APP
AMI		: COPY OF SERVER
ELB		: DISTRIBUTE LOAD BLW SERVERS
ASG		: CREATE SERVERS AUTOMATICALLY
CLOUD WATCH	: TO GET METRICS OF CLOUD RESOURCES

-> METRICS MEANS INFORMATION ABOUT SERVER.
     METRIC		: CPU, RAM, DISK -------

i) TYPES OF DASHBOARDS:
1. CUSTOM : USERS WILL CREATE
2. AUTOMATIC: AWS WILL CREATE THE AUTOMATICALLY


STEP-1: CREATE EC2 AND DEPLOY THE APPLICATION

CREATE A SERVER AND RUN THE SCRIPT
SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash
sudo -i
apt update
apt install nginx  -y
git clone https://github.com/karishma1521success/swiggy-clone.git
mv swiggy-clone/* /var/www/html/



STEP-2: CREAT A DASHBOARD
-> CLOUD WATCH:
-> CREATE DASHBOARD
-> NAME: DASHBOARD1
-> WIDGET: LINE
-> EC2
-> EC2: PER INSTANCE METRICS
-> GIVE ID OF YOUR SERVER
-> SELECT CPUUTILIZATION
-> CREATE WIDGET

TO GET MORE LOAD:
-> sudo -i
-> apt update
-> apt install stress -y
-> stress -c 4

iii) EPEL: EXTRA PACKAGES FOR ENTERPRISE LINUX

-> GO TO DASHBOARD AND CLICK ON SHARE THE DASHBOARD
-> GENERATE A LINK AND COPY PASTE



iv) HOW TO CREATE ALARM:
-> CLOUD WATCH 
-> ALL ALARM
-> CREATE ALARM
-> SELECT METRIC
-> EC2
-> EC2: PER INSTANCE METRICS
-> CPUUtilization
-> 60 -- > NEXT
-> CREATE A SNS TOPIC -- > new topic -- > email
-> EC2 ACTION:STOP



=================11-09-2025==== Session 14=======================>

25) IAM (Identity Access Management):
----------------------------------------------------
--> IAM IS used to Provide permission and Restriction To the User in Aws.

1) IAM USER
2) IAM Group
3) IAM Policies
4) IAM Role


--> Authentication : Permission to login
--> Authorization: Permission to work.
--> Policies: set of permission (total 7)


--> IN REAL TIME WE DONT USE ROOT USER FOR ROUTINE WORKS
-->WE USE AWS IAM USER IN REAL TIME. (FOR DAILY WORKS)


1) IAM USER: 

---> IAM -- > USERS -- > CREATE USER -- > NAME: ABC -- > Provide user access to the AWS Management Console -- > I want to create an IAM user -- > Next -- > Attach policies directly -- > AmazonReadOnlyAccess -- > 

ADDING NEW PERMISSION:-
--> IAM -- > USER -- > PERMISSION --> ADD PERMISSION 

2) IAM GROUP:
--> USED TO GIVE PERMISSION FOR MULTIPLE USERS.
--> A SINGLE USER CAN BE PART OF MAX 10 GROUPS.
--> GROUP CANNOT BE NESTED.
--> IF USER HAVE PERMISSION ON GROUP LEVEL AND USER LEVEL BOTH OF THE APPLIES.

create few users without permissions
--> IAM -- > USER GROUPS -- > NAME: DEVOPS -- > SELECT USERS -- > Attach policies directly -- > CREATE

--> IF U FROGOT USERNANE &PASSWORD:
--> SELECT USER -- > SECURITY CREDNTIALS -- > MANAGE CONSOLE ACCESS


3) IAM ROLES:
--> ROLES ARE USED BY SERVICES.
--> ROLE IS SIMLAR TO IAM USER.
--> ROLES ALSO HAVING PERMISSION LIKE USERS.
--> ROLE DOESNT HAVE ANY CREDS.
--> WE CAN SET TIME LIMIT FOR ROLES.
--> IF TWO SERVICES WANT TO COMMUNICATE OR WORK TOGETHER WE USE ROLES.
      EX: EC2 -- > S3

http://54.242.59.171/

--> ROLE -- > CREATE ROLE -- > AWS SERVICE -- > EC2 -- > PERMISSIONS: S3 FULL ACCESS -- > NAME: S3 ROLE -- > CREATE

ATTACH ROLE TO SRVER:
--> SELECT SERVER -- > ACTIONS -- > SECURITY -- > MODIFY IAM ROLE -- > S3 ROLE -- > UPDATE

--> DEPLOY THE APP FROM SCRIPT 
--> GO TO SERVER

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
apt install unzip -y
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install


command: aws s3 ls -- > execute this on server
aws s3 cp /var/log/ngix/access.log s3:bucketname

--> REVOKE SESSION: TO REMOVE THE EXISTING PERMISSION OF A ROLE.

--> INLINE POLICY: CREATING CUSTOM POLICY FOR RESOURCES

--> USER -- > ADD PERMISSION -- > CREATE INLINE POLICY -- > SERVICE: S3 -- > All S3 actions (s3:*) -- > bucket: BUCKETNAME -- > next


Q1. DIFF BLW AUTHENTICATION VS AUTHORIZATION ?
A.    AUTHENTICATION : PERMISSION TO LOGIN
        AUTHORIZATION  : PERMISSION TO WORK

Q2. HOW TWO services COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER ?
A     USING ROLES

Q3. CAN WE CREATE NESTED GROUPS IN AWS ?
A     NO

Q4. HOW MANY GROPUPS CAN A SINGLE USER CAN BE PART OF ?
A.  10

Q5. DIFF BLW IAM USER & ROLES >
A   USER WILL HAVE CREDS, ROLES WILL NOT HAVE
    USER WONT HAVE TIME LIMIT BY DEFAULT, ROLES WILL HAVE
    USER: USER -- SERVICE  ROLE: SERVICE -- SERVICE

Q6. CAN WE ATTACH MULTIPPLE ROLES TO USER ?
A    YES

Q7. HOW DO YOU RESTRICT A SPECIFIC PERMISSION TO USER ?
A. PERMISSION BOUNDARY

Q8. BY DEFAULT FOR A USER HOW MANY KEYS WE CAN CREATE ?
A. 2

Q9. IF YOU LOST YOUR KEYS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO ?
A. DEACTIVE THE KEYS

Q10. I HAVE A SPECIAL BUCKET WHERE MY CUSTOMRE NEED TO ACCESS FILES HOW DO YOU PROVIDE PERMISSION TO THAT CUSTOMER ?
A. INLINE POLICY

Q11. WHAT IS THE POLICY FORMAT ?
A. JSON(JAVA SCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION)


=================12-09-2025==== Session 15=======================>

26) CLI (command line interface):
------------------------------------

--> maneging any aws service by CLI.

--> USER -- > KEYS (PERMISSIONS) -- > SERVER
--> ACCESS KEY & SECRET ACCESS KEY = USED TO ASSIGN PERMISSION TO SERVER
--> BY DEFAULT WE CAN CREATE ONLY 2 KEYS.

--> WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOU LOST THE KEYS?
      ANS: DEACTIVATE THE KEYS

--> NOTE: PLS DONT DELETE THEM WITHOUT DEACTIVATE

FLOW: USER -- > KEYS -- > ATTACH TO SERVER -- > SERVER

CREATE A USER WTH ADMIN ACCESS

CREATE A USER -- > SECURITY CREDENTIALS -- > CREATE ACCESS KEY -- >

28) CDN:-
29) cloud trail

--> In AWS, a Content Delivery Network (CDN), such as Amazon CloudFront, is used to speed up the delivery of static and dynamic content (like websites, videos, applications, and APIs) to users globally. It achieves this by caching content on a network of servers in edge locations worldwide, which are geographically closer to users. This reduces latency, improves performance, and enhances security

--> TTL:- TTL stand for "Time to take" application exam: 1st time it take time to load application but second time it does not take time. 1st time request go to server second time it does not goes to server i go to server. we can give time 5 min, 10 min, 1 day, 2 day.

CDN: CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK
USED TO DELIVER APP FROM EDGE LOCATION
IT GIVES FAST RESPONSE 
EX: CRICKET MATCHES, E-COMMERCE SALES, ------

WE NEED TO CREATE ORIGIN
ORIGIN: FROM WHERE YOU ORIGINAL APPLICATION IS COMMING

EXAMPLE OF ORIGINS: S3, ELB, API GATEWAY

Origin Shield
Its an additional caching layer that can help reduce the load on your origin and help protect its availability.

ADVANTAGES:
1. REDUCE LATENCY
2. CUT COST
3. CUSTOMIZE DELIVERY
4. SECURITY

FREE TIER:
1 TB of data transfer out
10,000,000 HTTP or HTTPS requests
2,000,000 CloudFront Function invocations
Each month, always free


NOTE: FROM LB WE NEED TO ACCESS APP FROM HTTP NOT HTTPS

STEP-1: CREATE 2 SERVERS AND DEPLOY AMAZON APP
STEP-2: CREATE A LOAD BALANCER
SETP-3: CLOUD FRONT -- > NAME -- > SINGLE APP -- > NEXT -- > ORIGIN DOMAIN: ELB (SELECT YOUR LB) -- > Customize -- > Protocol: HTTP only (ORIGIN PROTOCOL)
-- > Enable Origin Shield: US-EAST-1  -- > Protocol: HTTPS(CLOUD FRONT PROTOCOL) -- > SELECT WAF -- > IPv6: OFF -- > CREATE

NOTE: IT WILL TAKE 2 MINS TO ACTIVATE 

HOW TO BLOCK USERS FROM DIFF LOCATIONS:
SECURITY -- > CloudFront geographic restrictions

MORE DATA: OPEN WAF



CLOUD TRAIL: IT WILL SHOW SERVICES ACCESSED BY USER
BY DEFAULT IT STORES LAST 90 DAYS OF ACTIVITIES.
$2.00 per 1,00,000 management events delivered.
$0.10 per 100,000 network activity events delivered

BY DEFAULT CLOUD TRAIL WILL RECORD ALL EVENTS
BUT I WANT ON SPECIFI EVENTS (S3, EC2) WE NEED TO CREATE CLOUD TRAIL 

Trail name: my-users-events

NEXT
Events: Management & Data
Resource: s3
Create trail

Q1. HOW DO YOU TRACK USERATVITIES IN AWS ?
A:  CLOUD TRAIL

Q2. ONE OF THE USER DELETED ON SERVER IN AWS ACCOUNT HOW DO YOU FIND THEM ?
A:  CLOUD TRAIL

Q3. BY DEFAULT HOW MANY DAYS EVENTS SHOULD BE STORED ?
A: 90 DAYS

Q4. CAN WE FILER EVENTS SEPERATELY FOR A RESOURCE ?
A: YES

4. CREATE EBS FROM SNAPSHOT
SELECT SNAPHSOT -- > ACTIONS -- > CREATE A VOLUME -- > AZ: US-EAST-2B -- > CREATE

5. CREATE A SERVER ON AP-SOUTH-1 & DETACH EXISTING VOLUME
CREATE A SERVER -- > SELECT -- > STOP 
VOLUME -- > SELECT -- > ACTIONS -- > DETACH

6. ATTACH THE VOLUME CREATED FROM SNAPSHOT
VOLUME -- > ACTIONS -- > ATTACH -- > SELECT SERVER -- > DEVICENAME: FIRST OPTION -- > ATTACH


Q1. HOW DATA WILL BE STORED ON EC2 ?
A.  EBS

Q2. HOW TO TAKE SERVER BACKUP ?
A. SNAPSHOTS

Q3. ARE SNAPSHOTS & EBS REGION AND AZ SPECIFIC ?
A. YES

Q4. MIN AND MAX SIZE OF EBS ?
A.  8 GB - 16 TB

Q5. CAN WE ATTACH MULTIPLE EBS TO SERVERS AT A TIME ?

PEERING: ESTABLISHING CONNECTION BLW 2 VPCS

TRANSIT GATEWAY:
networking service that allows you to connect multiple VPCs, on-premises networks, and other AWS resources through a central hub. 

VPC Endpoints: provide a secure and private connection between your VPC & AWS services, without requiring access over the public internet. 
This is useful for scenarios where you want to avoid exposing sensitive data to the internet while enabling private communication between resources in your VPC and services like Amazon S3, DynamoDB, or other AWS services.
