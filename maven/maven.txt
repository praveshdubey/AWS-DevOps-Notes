===============Session 38:- 16th oct============================= 

Maven:

raw mutton -- > clean  --> marnet -- > ingredients -- > Mutton Biryani
raw code    -- > build   -- > test  -- > artifact -- > Deployment


ARTIFACT: its final product of our code.
developers will give raw code that code we are going to convert into artifact.


TYPES:
1. jar        : Java Archive       : Backend code
2. war        : Web Archive             : Frontend code + Backend code
3. ear        : Enterprise Archive : jar + war 


JAR FILE:


.java -- > compile -- > .class -- > .jar file


.java        : basic raw
.class        : executable file
.jar        : artifact
        
all the artifacts are going to created by a build too1.




MAVEN:
Maven is the build tool.
build: process of adding the libs & dependencies to code.
its a free and opensource.
its a platform independent tool.
its is also called as Project management too1.
it will manage the complete structure of the project.
the main file in the maven tool is POM.XML


POM.XML: its a file which consist of complete project information.
Ex: name, artifact, tools, libs, dep --------


POM: PROJECT OBJECT MODEL
XML: EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE


WHO GIVE POM.XML : DEVELOPERS
dev will give both code and pom.xml in github


maven is written on java by apache software foundation.
supports: JAVA-1.8.0
year: 2004
home path: .m2




PRATCICAL PART:
1. CREATE AN UBUNTU EC2 INSTANCE AND CONNECT


2. apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk maven tree -y
mvn -v
update-alternatives --config java (when u dont see java 1.8.0 for maven use the command)


3. git clone https://github.com/devopsbyraham/jenkins-java-project.git
4. cd jenkins-java-project




[ERROR] Source option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
[ERROR] Target option 5 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
SOL: 
yum remove java* maven* -y


ERROR: [ERROR] The goal you specified requires a project to execute but there is no POM in this directory (/root/jenkins-java-project).
SOL: CHECK POM.XML IS THERE OR NOT


MAVEN LIFECYCLE:
GOALS : a command used to run a task.
Goals refers pom.xml to execute.


NOTE: Without Pom.xml Goals will Not Execute.


PLUGIN: its a small software with makes our work automated.
instead of downloading tools we can download plugins.
this plugins will download automatically when we run goals.




1. mvn compile : used to compile the code (.java [src] -- > .class [target])
2. mvn test    : used to test the code    (.java [test] -- > .class [target])
3. mvn package : used to create artifact 
4. mvn install : used to copy artifact to .m2 (project folder -- > .m2)
5. mvn clean   : to delete the target folder


6. mvn clean package: compile -- > package


mvn clean     : remove old war files
mvn package   : compile -- > test -- > artifact




PROBLEMS WITHOUT MAVEN:
1. we cant create artifacts.
2. We cant create project structure. [mvn archetype:generate]
3. we cant build and deploy the apps.


ALTERNATIVIES:
MAVEN, ANT, GRADLE, NPM


PROGRAMMING VS BUILD:


JAVA        : MAVEN
PYTHON        : GRADLE
.NET        : VS CODE
C, C#        : MAKE FILE
node.js        : npm


ALTERNETIAVES: 
ANT, GRADLE for java projects.


MAVEN VS ANT:
1. MAVEN IS BUILD & PROJECT MANAGEMNT, ANT IS ONLY BUILD TOOL
2. MAVEN HAS POM.XML, ANT HAS BUILD.XML
3. MAVEN HAS A LIFECYCLE, ANT WILL NOT HAVE LIFECYCLE
4. MAVEN PLUGINS ARE REUSABLE, ANT SCRIPTS ARE NOT RESUEABLE.
5. MAVEN IS DECLARATIVE, ANT IS PROCEDURAL.


SYNOPSIS:
maven is a build tool -- > artifacts -- > java & python -- > mvn clean package
remove old artifact and compile, test and create artifact to deploy the app
